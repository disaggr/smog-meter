Definition of the tracing output format:

smog-meter will produce one tracing record every measurement interval. the
tracing record header will consist of the following data:

4 Bytes	The unix timestamp seconds of the measurement
4 Bytes	The unix timestamp microseconds of the measurement
4 Bytes The number of VMAs contained in the record

Following this information, there are a number of VMA records equal to the
number of VMAs encoded in the record header. Each VMA record header contains
the following information:
	
8 Bytes	The start address of the VMA
8 Bytes The end address of the VMA
4 Bytes The number of pages in the VMA

Following this information, the page data of the VMA is encoded. Each page is
encoded with two bits, the lower bit indicates whether the page is present in
physical RAM, the higher bit encodes whether the page is dirty. The page
records are encoded in least-significant-bit first, little endian 4-Byte
integers.

After the page data, the next VMA or tracing record starts aligned at a 4-Byte
boundary.

Also refer to read_trace.py for an implementation of this data format.
